# Google Classroom Name Extractor

I really like to use my ['Wheel of Doom' random name picker](https://wheelofnames.com/qeh-8dt) to  randomly select students for questioning, showing off their work etc. Manually typing out all of their names was a drag and meant that for some classes, I never got around to using it at all.

Enter the **Google Classroom Name Extractor**. This script pulls all the names of all the students in all the Google Classrooms you're a teacher of. It puts them in neat columns for easy copy and pasting into most common random name/team generator tools.

## How to Use

1. **Copy the Template Google Sheet**:
   - Make a copy of the [template Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DDSE63dyeg4mZdhb0Ghf_pp_3UtdResc2SkTXr7VhUw/edit?usp=sharing).

2. **Authorise the script**:
   - In the copied Google Sheet, go to `Classroom Name Extrator` -> `Get all the names!`. It may take a few seconds to appear the first time you open it.
   - Click `OK` and `Continue` at the appropriate points to authorise the script.
   - Nothing else will happen at this stage

4. **Run the script again**:
   - Click on `Classroom Name Extrator` -> `Get all the names!` again.
   - Wait patiently. Depending on the number of Google Classrooms you have, this could take anywhere between 10s and 2mins.

If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request. The script is very rough and ready so some niceties like proper formatting would be awesome!
