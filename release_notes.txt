Release notes

Changes since v0.01-alpha -> main

Highlights
- Turned a short script into a documented and more robust utility for extracting student given names from Google Classroom into Sheets.
- Added comprehensive file-level documentation / usage instructions in `code.gs`.
- Fixed the menu label typo: "Classroom Name Extrator" -> "Classroom Name Extractor".
- Implemented pagination in `getStudents()` to retrieve all students across multiple pages from the Classroom API.
- Filter only ACTIVE courses before attempting to fetch rosters (avoids writing empty/irrelevant columns).
- Improved handling when there are no active courses (writes a clear message instead of leaving the sheet blank).

Files changed
- code.gs: Documentation, bug fixes, pagination handling, active-course filtering, and output safety checks.

Notes
- No API or OAuth scope changes were added beyond those documented in-file. Ensure the Classroom Advanced Service is enabled and the Classroom API is enabled in the Cloud Console before use.
- This release is a functional improvement (bugfix + usability) and does not change the public API surface outside the Apps Script project file.
